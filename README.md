Spring Boot: Practical Guide to Unit Testing with Mockito and JUnit5

This project is a learning exercice aimed at mastering unit testing using Mockito in a Spring Boot application.
The primary objective is to understand how to effectively implement unit tests for the **studentMapper** and **studentService** components using Junit5.

# Technologies Used
- Java Version : 21
- Spring Boot Version : 3.3.4
- Dependencies :
Spring Data JPA
Spring Web
MySQL Driver
Lombok

- Database: MySQL

# Testing Frameworks
- JUnit 5 : Used for writing and running unit tests
- Mockito : Used for mocking dependencies and simulating behaviors during testing.

# Key Features
- Integration of **Mockito** for unit testing.
- Testing services and mappers without relying on a real database.
- Mocking dependencies to focus on the functionality of individual units.
